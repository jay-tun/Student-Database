This is another small project from freecodecamp.

Given a dataset with numerous rows, we want to create a bash shell script that allows you to put in the data from the datasheet to a relational database(in this case PostgreSQL).

As such, insert_data.sh takes input from datasheets students.csv and courses.csv and structur it to automate the process of building a database.

Hope this is a helpful reference for you.
